// Package pow implements a basic version of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm.
// Proof of Work is used to secure the blockchain by requiring participants to solve a computationally intensive puzzle 
// before adding new blocks. The concept of mining, difficulty, and nonce adjustment forms the core of PoW, which was
// popularized by Bitcoin. This package demonstrates the mining process and how blocks are linked together to maintain
// a tamper-proof blockchain.

// Footer: Security Considerations and Architectural Decisions
//
// This implementation of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus demonstrates the essential principles of mining and achieving consensus
// in a distributed blockchain environment. Below are the key architectural decisions and security considerations:
//
// 1. **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 is used to hash the block contents, including the nonce, to produce a unique identifier for each block.
//    This ensures data integrityâ€”if any part of the block is altered, the resulting hash will be completely different,
//    making tampering immediately evident.
//
// 2. **Proof of Work Mining**: The mining process involves incrementing the nonce until a hash is found that matches the required
//    difficulty. This computational challenge ensures that adding a new block is resource-intensive, which deters malicious actors
//    from attempting to alter the blockchain, as they would need to re-mine all subsequent blocks.
//
// 3. **Mining Difficulty**: The difficulty level is set to 4 leading zeros for simplicity. In real-world systems, this value is adjusted dynamically
//    to control the rate of block creation. A higher difficulty makes mining more challenging, thus increasing the security of the network.
//    In production environments, adjusting difficulty helps maintain a consistent rate of block generation.
//
// 4. **Tamper Resistance**: The hash of each block includes the hash of the previous block, creating a linked chain. This ensures that
//    any change to one block would require re-mining all subsequent blocks, making it computationally infeasible to tamper with
//    the blockchain without controlling the majority of computational resources (as seen in the "51% attack" scenario).
//
// 5. **Genesis Block**: The genesis block is created when the blockchain is initialized and serves as the root of trust for the chain.
//    The integrity of the entire chain depends on the immutability of this initial block.
//
// This basic implementation highlights how PoW contributes to the security and immutability of blockchain networks by leveraging 
// computational difficulty. It also provides a foundational understanding of how blockchain data structures can be secured against
// unauthorized changes and how decentralized consensus is achieved through mining.
