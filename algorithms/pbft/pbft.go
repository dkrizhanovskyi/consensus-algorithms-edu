// Package pbft implements a basic version of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm.
// PBFT is designed to allow a group of nodes to reach consensus in a distributed system, even in the presence
// of Byzantine faultsâ€”nodes that may behave arbitrarily or maliciously. This module simulates a blockchain 
// network using PBFT to demonstrate how nodes work together to validate and commit new blocks, ensuring consistency 
// and resilience against malicious actors. The algorithm requires agreement from at least 2/3 of the nodes 
// for a block to be committed.

// Footer: Security Considerations and Architectural Decisions
//
// This implementation of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) demonstrates how nodes in a distributed system
// can reach consensus even when some nodes may act maliciously or exhibit arbitrary behavior. The consensus mechanism
// is designed to tolerate Byzantine faults by requiring agreement from at least 2/3 of the nodes before committing a block.
//
// 1. **Cryptographic Hashing**: Each block's integrity is ensured through the use of SHA-256 hashing. This prevents 
//    unauthorized modifications to blocks, as any change in the block's contents would lead to a different hash.
// 
// 2. **Primary Node Role**: The primary node (or leader) is responsible for proposing new blocks. If the primary fails
//    or acts maliciously, the network must implement a "view change" process to elect a new primary (not implemented here).
//
// 3. **2/3 Majority Consensus**: To tolerate Byzantine faults, a proposed block must receive approvals from at least 
//    2/3 of the nodes before being committed. This ensures that even if some nodes act maliciously, they cannot compromise
//    the consistency of the blockchain.
//
// 4. **Block Verification**: Each node verifies proposed blocks by checking both the previous hash link and recalculating
//    the current block's hash. This two-step verification process ensures both continuity in the chain and data integrity.
//
// This implementation is simplified for educational purposes and demonstrates the core principles of PBFT consensus.
// In a production system, more sophisticated techniques for handling node failures, view changes, and message 
// authentication would be required to maintain resilience and security in a real-world distributed network.
